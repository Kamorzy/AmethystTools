# Amethyst Tools

This is a Fabric mod for Minecraft that adds amethyst tools, an optional step between iron and diamond tools.

## Purpose

Amethyst tools are meant to be an early game alternative to rushing for diamond. The very high enchantability makes them useful for quickly getting into early game projects with good enchantments. This is balanced by the need to find a geode and have silk touch (or permanently destroying budding blocks) to start making amethyst tools.

Diamond outclasses it in everything except enchantability, making it arguably reasonable to just skip amethyst entirely and focus that time and energy on diamond tools. The goal of its balance is to make the optimal tool progression less clear, depending on situation and priorities of different players.

Amethyst tools are also good "disposable" tools after getting good diamond tools. If you need to risk your equipment (e.g. in the Nether or End), amethyst tools have a much lower time investment to replace than diamond.

## Details

The stats for amethyst, related to vanilla materials, are:

| Material | Speed | Durability | Enchantability |
| -------- | ----- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Gold     | 12    | 32         | 22             |
| Iron     | 6     | 250        | 14             |
| Amethyst | 7.5   | 1062       | 19             |
| Diamond  | 8     | 1561       | 10             |

It has a mining level of iron, so it cannot mine obsidian.

Its recipes use amethyst clusters, so silk touch is normally needed to craft amethyst tools. Alternatively, 0-3 amethyst clusters are now also dropped when budding amethyst blocks are broken with any pickaxe.
