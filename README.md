# Amethyst Tools
## Purpose

Amethyst tools are meant to be an early game alternative to rushing for diamond. They are much better than iron if you can find a geode early. However, since finding geodes is unreliable, its most common use is likely for players who'd rather take their time in the early game, but want to still build things without having to constantly replace iron tools.

## Mechanics
Breaking a budding amethyst block now drops 0-1 amethyst clusters

Amethyst tools have the mining level of iron, so they can't mine obsidian
