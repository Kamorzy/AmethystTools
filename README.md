# Amethyst Tools

This is a Fabric mod for Minecraft that adds Amethyst tools

## Stats

The stats for Amethyst Tools, related to vanilla tools, are:

| Material | Speed | Durability | Enchantability |
| -------- | ----- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Gold     | 12    | 32         | 22             |
| Iron     | 6     | 250        | 14             |
| Amethyst | 7.33  | 960        | 19             |
| Diamond  | 8     | 1561       | 10             |

It has a mining level of Iron, so it cannot mine obsidian.

Its recipes use Amethyst Clusters, so silk touch is required to craft Amethyst tools.

## Intended Use

An optional step between Iron and Diamond. It has a high enough durability to make using it for early game projects much more bearable than Iron. The very high enchantability makes it useful for quickly getting into early game projects with good enchantments. This is balanced by the need to find the geodes and have silk touch to start making Amethyst tools.

Diamond still outclasses it in most stats, making it arguably reasonable to just skip Amethyst entirely. That questionable usefulness of it is intended to maintain roughly vanilla balance.

Amethyst tools are also good "disposable" tools after getting good diamond tools. If you need to risk your equipment (e.g. in the Nether or End), Amethyst tools have a much lower time investment to recover from than Diamond.
